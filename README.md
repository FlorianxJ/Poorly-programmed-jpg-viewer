# Poorly-programmed-jpg-viewer
It´s my first time programming so it´s really bad but hey here i am posting my result.
It is intended as a kind of E-Book reader and works based on a command promt.
You first have to choose the folder with the jpg´s you want to view.
It will open files based on the number in their name.
First file 1 than 2 and so on.
To switch to the next jpg you have to clodse the existing window containing the image.
Than press e to open the next jpg. If you accidentaly cloesed the image just use any letter other than e to get it back.
If you write e ten times than it will open the next ten jpg´s automaticly.
But be aware that q would work in the same way because the application will just process one letter after another.
To exit hit esc or skip trough all the images and if you are some kind of rebel just close the command promt.
The result is gonna be the same.

If you wanna improve it just do so i am gonna have all the code upploaded in the code txt file, if you pan to upload it to github please leave a link unter this Psot.
