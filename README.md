# jpg-viewer/reader
It´s my first time programming so it´s really bad but hey here i am posting my result.
It is intended as a kind of E-Book reader and works based on a command promt.
You first have to choose the folder with the jpg´s you want to view.
To scroll the picture use the scroling bar or mouse wheel.
It will open files based on the number in their name. (It works even without numers but dont ask me how)
First file 1 than 2 and so on.
To switch to the next jpg you have to close the existing window containing the image.
Than press e to open the next jpg. If you accidentaly closed the image just use any letter other than e to get it back.
If you press e ten times than it will open the next ten jpg´s automaticly one after another.
But be aware that any letter other than e would work in the same way because the application will just process one letter after another.
To exit hit esc or skip trough all the images and if you are some kind of rebel just close the command promt.
The result is gonna be the same.

If you wanna improve it just do so i am gonna have all the code uploaded in the Jpg reader .txt file.

A brief description provided by chatgpt3 would be:

This code is a simple image viewer that prompts the user to select a folder of images and then displays each image in the folder one by one.
The program uses the Windows Forms library to create a window that displays the selected image.
The window can be scrolled to view the image and can be closed with the ESC key.
Additionally, the user can press the "E" key to move to the next image.
If there is a problem loading the image, an appropriate error message is displayed.
