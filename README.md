# Poorly-programmed-jpg-viewer
It´s my first time programming so it´s really bad but hey here i am posting my result.
It is intended as a kind of E-Book reader and works based on a command promt.
You first have to choose the folder with the jpg´s you want to view.
Please use the scroling bar mouse wheel scrooling is bugged.
It will open files based on the number in their name. (It works even without numers but dont ask me how)
First file 1 than 2 and so on.
To switch to the next jpg you have to close the existing window containing the image.
Than press e to open the next jpg. If you accidentaly cloesed the image just use any letter other than e to get it back.
If you write e ten times than it will open the next ten jpg´s automaticly one after another.
But be aware that any letter other than e would work in the same way because the application will just process one letter after another.
To exit hit esc or skip trough all the images and if you are some kind of rebel just close the command promt.
The result is gonna be the same.

If you wanna improve it just do so i am gonna have all the code uploaded in the Jpg reader .txt file.
